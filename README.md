## About me
Nothing gives me more joy than working on (and solving) a data problem.

- I have developed an organisation-wide procedure to collect, store, and analyse data from Ghana, the UK, Uganda, Rwanda, and Zambia.
- I have migrated an organisation from an Excel-based to a SaaS-based CRM system, designing and configuring the architecture, building analysis tools, and providing training.
- I can do cool things with Excel's PowerQuery and PowerBI.
- I am currently learning Python.
